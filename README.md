# Improper Error Handling in Express.js User Creation Endpoint

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling during database interactions.  The `bug.js` file shows a user creation endpoint that fails to properly handle missing or invalid user data and database errors, resulting in incomplete or missing error responses to the client. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.
